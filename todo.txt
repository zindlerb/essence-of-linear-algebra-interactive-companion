[ ] move vector into position for example 1
[ ] add text
[ ] do addition example
[ ] add text
[ ] add scaling feature
[ ] do multiplication example
[ ] have option without grid line
[ ] add labels to axis
[ ] unit vectors
[ ] hover to highligth unit vector
[ ] scrubbable numbers on the symbolic vector





[x] component to render symbolic vectors
	[x] add prop types
[ ] modify api of the graph renderer
  [x] remove data class
  [x] remove state service
	[x] hook up symbolic and vector display
	[x] make cursor allways display while dragging
	[x] scale grid. Make the drag snap to grid lines
	[x] fix the 0 and 1 on coordinate grid
	[x] disallow dragging off of the edge
	[ ] add background grid disabling
		ticks - match 3 brown
  [ ] clean up vector styles
		[x] grabby hand
		[ ] try to match the 3blue1brown
		[x] dot should signify when the user hovers
			[x] get slightly bigger
		[x] dot should not be so close to arrow head

		[ ] need to have ticks
	[ ] add labeling of axis
	[ ] Add scaling handle
[ ] passable prop for if it is scrubbable or not
	[ ] onhover for data points
		general onhover that returns the col and row
  [ ] I should probably have an onchange for each
    it is the responsibility of the caller to set the new value
    [
      { onChange: (newVal) => , value },
    ]

    or just:
    [
      [10, 10],
      [20, 20],
    ]

    onDrag =>
           return new vector whole
[ ] create regular example example
	[ ] line up symbolid and graph - make sure graph is big enough
[ ] create addition example
[ ] create multiplication
[ ] clean up text revise
